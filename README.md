# covid-country-list-app
This is a homework assignment that involved creating an android app that would show a list of countries with their covid cases as well as a more detailed view with their deaths and recovered cases.

I used jetpack compose to create the app and the disease.sh api to obtain the covid data needed for the app. (https://github.com/disease-sh/API)
